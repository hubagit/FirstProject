// What we can have inside one Class 
	Also see -- Tuesday notes 


// Inheritance 
	
	a class can use fields and methods from another class 
	by extending it, instead of creating everything from scracth 

	IS-A Relationship 
		Student IS-A Person 
		LocalStudent IS-A Student 
		Car - Vehicle 

	What keyword to build relationship 
			public class Student extends Person{

			}

	How many classes a class can extend directly 
		a class can only extend one from another class directly 
		BAD!!! : 
		public class Student extends Person, Human, Robot{} 


	Child--> Parent--> GrandParent--> Object (class)
	
	Child c1 = new Child() ; 
	c1.everyVisibleFieldsAndMethod.....


	What's inherited from super class 
		All visible fields / methods from super class 
		Constructor IS NOT INHERITED 	

	Visibility : 
		private : ----> in same class 
		default : ----> same package 
		protected: ---> same package+sub classes outside package
		public : -----> everywhere 


	Constructor : 
		how can we call other constructors of SAME CLASS
			this(arg...) 
				 it has to be first statement 
				 it can only be called once 
				 recursive calls should be avoided 
				 	-- you call me , i call you --compiler error!!!

		how can we call super class constructor 
			super(arg...)
				 it has to be first statement 
				 it can only be called once
				 if no constructor, call is made already 
				 	super() will be inserted in first line 
				 super() and this() can not show up together 
				 	in same constructor 
				 CAN NOT CALL A CONSTUCTOR that we don't have 


	super(args..)
	
	TASK 1 
Create classes as below 
SlackUser
    displayName as String
    timezone as int
    status as String
constructor --
    no arg
    3 args to set All fields value
    sendMessage    
        have one parameter as message and has no return type
        print --- <displayName> is sending<Message>
    changeStatus
        accept one String as parameter and change status to new status
2 sub classes :
StudentUser
    groupNumber as int 
    
    Create a 4 args constructor to set all field values of StudentUser
    
    // generate toString method so we can print out object directly 
Optional : 
AdminUser
    adminLevel as int 
  
    Create a 4 args constructor to set all field values of AdminUser
   // generate toString method so we can print out object directly
